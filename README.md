# aws-udemy-pacing
For now, a quick python script to set up a nice Excel document to check how far along I am with my classes.

It's working. The pacing (and passing the Certification Exam) is done for AWS Cloud Practitioner. The pacing is done for the AWS Machine Learning Specialist Certification Course. I'm going to begin working on the input CVSs for two other courses from Udemy; I'm thinking about doing some web scraping to automate that creation. Those two classes are the Google TensorFlow Developer Certification and a Complete Tensorflow Course.
